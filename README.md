- (TW) Basically, I said I was quitting, and all of that,  I'll repost the file.. but after that shit I got forced to vent when I was uncomforable,(not good at explaining, mb) and then I had two mental breakdowns, in one fucking day.. alongside considering seeing the great holy gates, but thankfully my sister stopped me. And now i'm currently taking thearpy from him/her , so i'll be doing better, i'm already working on my anger issues, don't wonder why i'm happy that it's been two days since ive been mad, I get upset or mad like everyday, so this means a lot to me, plus i'm raising my self esteem, since my sister been talking to me, long talks for three hours or more.. i'm feeling better, and now she just watches my every move.. eugh, don't worry guys i'm gonna be fine.. yeah my sister suggested to not isolate myself for the better, I would listen to her mostly since she's the only one i'd actually trust, now please take care of yourselves and dont be like me.. - xoxo zibby . , and the bottom is what I said before, by the way. That shit is true, not to worry anyone, but I won;t lie about my feelings to friends.. not at all. I would hate to do so . even if I lied about the i'm gonna take care of myself part.. my arm isnt being taken cared of.. nor my body uh oh. don't worry i'm in " therapy / '

If you haven't seen ts ;
