˚.  ' ; Yes i'll be quitting ponytown, i'll be inactive a lot since i'm going through a lot of things at home, mostly because of myself.. and my own behavior, I don't wanna affect any of you, so i'll distance myself, isolate myself of misery and be alone for a bit.. I'll come back if my addictions heal, and stupid attactment issues, what's wrong with being attacted? You don't know half of me, I'm obsessed with NOT being alone, that I would be so desperate to even be near someone, once I loose a friend.. I will break down. It's not intentionally, I can't control myself, I don't think therapy will help, I was in elementary, with scars from my OWN PAIN, NOW I'M PAST THAT, AND I STILL WON'T FUCKING GROW UP AND ACT MATURE..i',m childish and i'm ashamed, I try so hard to be enough, but it's never enough, I pull my hair, I cry, I'm down on my knees in despair of being held, what the fuck is touch starved, what is eating disorderS?? WHAT IS ANGER ISSUES..it's really annoying where I had to wonder, "What's the point of me being here, just to grow up and live a so called fucking normal life, and gain trauma just for the people of above to watch it like some sick movie?" I was a victim before, and again.. and again. I'm sick of harassment, i'm sick of everything, I don't think I should be interacting much.. I'd doubt I will heal, but it's okay. As long as I don't hurt others, "By pushing yourself away." Listen, i'm very self aware of my bad habits and low self esteem, issues with hygenes and doing basic things.. yet it's like I can't do anything, I try .. then get shamed, out my insecurties. My family? oh boy.. if I tried talking.. ha.. you'd really see me crying on the ground :3 .. Just note that i'm gonan try to stop, but if my emotions just slip up, while I already have low hope, it's hopeless, i'm done with life. nobody SEES me again, remember when you saw me around? Oh look at me .. right at the dandy world fandom, i'll leave that spot empty, and break it into parts.. I write out how I feel just like now.  i'm being geniune when I said I cried while writing ts , Thanks for knowing me, thanks for being patient with me, thanks for ever giving me a chance, thanks for ever being friends with me and trying to. Thanks for even following someone like me, Thanks for c+h people letting me sit with them, and thanks to the stranger who comforted me when I wasn't okay, thanks to my friends for listening .. espically  Dizzy , I love you all . Please don't end up like me. Now may death do us apart .
